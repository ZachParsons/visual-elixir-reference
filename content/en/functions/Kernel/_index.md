Kernel is Elixir's default environment.

It mainly consists of:

- basic language primitives, such as arithmetic operators, spawning of processes, data type handling, and others
- macros for control-flow and defining new functionality (modules, functions, and the like)
- guard checks for augmenting pattern matching

You can invoke `Kernel` functions and macros anywhere in Elixir code without the use of the `Kernel.` prefix since they have all been automatically imported.
